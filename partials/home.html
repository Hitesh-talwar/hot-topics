    <p>Money is a dependent variable that affects the many decisions people make in their lives, ranging from collegiate enrollment and job decisions to simple/major investments. Intentionally we make some of our biggest life decisions in accordance with money. But what makes money so fascinating? Perhaps it’s the idea that these multi-colored bills and coins in our wallets allow us to set occupational goals for future successes . <br> Happiness can’t be bought, but show me a sad person buying a new Mercedes or BMW. The relationship between money and its owner is in how it’s handled. Money can be a gateway toward happiness and financial safety, a grave into debt and IOUs, or a lock and safe for the more greed-driven.<br> The value of money changes in the hands of its possessor but not in a physical manner, but a metaphysical one. As an abstract value money is infinitely malleable, represented as a symbolic entity of power, greed, happiness, security, potential and status.<br> Well economically, the value of money is determined by the demand for it, just like the value of goods and services. There are three ways to measure the value of the dollar. The first is how much the dollar will buy in foreign currencies. For this reason, the value of money fluctuates throughout the trading day. The second method is the value of Treasury notes. They can be converted easily into dollars through the secondary market for Treasuries. The third way is through foreign exchange reserves. That is the amount of dollars held by foreign governments.<br> In life, it holds its own importance. It is often said that money is not the most important thing in the world. For many people, however, it is right up there next to air in importance. They simply understand the true value of money. Money, in and of itself, is not very spectacular. What money can do for you is what is really important. Money gives you freedom and choices. You can decide where and how you want to live when you have a good income or financial resources. On the other hand, when you do not have much money, choice may be something that you cannot afford. The choices available to you may not really be choices at all. </p>

        <h2>The GMO Food.</h2>

        <p>Genetically modified foods or GM foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.<br> Modern genetic engineering differs in two ways: Only one or a few new genes with a known function are introduced into a crop, and sometimes the new genes come from an unrelated species. Thus, a gene meant to instill frost tolerance into, say, spinach, might come from a fish that lives in icy waters. But the main question arises here is that, is this GMO food safe for health ?<br> In the decades since the first genetically modified foods reached the market, no adverse health effects among consumers have been found. This is not to say there are none, but as hard as opponents of the technology have looked, none have yet been definitely identified.<br> Although about 90 percent of scientists believe G.M.O.s are safe.The fears of G.M.O.s are still theoretical, like the possibility that insertion of one or a few genes could have a negative impact on other desirable genes naturally present in the crop, or the creation of allergens and toxic effects on bodily organs, or unwanted changes in nutritional content.<br> Nonetheless, gene modification scientists are focusing increasingly on building health benefits into widely used foods. In addition to pink pineapples containing the tomato-based antioxidant lycopene, tomatoes are being engineered to contain the antioxidant-rich purple pigment from blueberries.<br> And people in developing countries faced with famine and malnutrition are likely to benefit from attempts to improve the protein content of food crops, as well as the amount of vitamins and minerals they provide.

        <h2>The View Of World In 2100.</h2>

        <p>I always keep complaining about how much this world is crowded. But then, this thought about the view of world in 2100 just gets me at the right track. I always wonder what if someone from 2100 could visit ua now, how would we view them?Probably like the gods of mythology. How would they feel?<br> I always start predicting for what that world, 100 years in the future, will look like. Even I've read about some prototypes of these life chaging inventions already exist.<br> First of all, the internet will be in our contact lens. Imagin this going online, accessing your files, download any song, any movie. Even the computers will disappear. Chips costing less than a penny apiece, will be hidden in our environment. Imagine just we will be able to command these hidden computers telepathically, directly via the mind. Computers will interpret the electrical signals emitted by our brains, decipher them, and carry out our wishes.<br> Our cars will be driver-less, using GPS to navigate without the help of an alert human behind the wheel. These cars will also fly by application of concept of magnetism. The traffic jams and accidents will be a thing of the past. <br> Doctors will eb able ti grow organs for our body from a single genome. Even we can see some examples from the past like dolly, the cloned sheep.<br> Doctors will be able to diagnose cancer early maybe with some kind of technique of using nanoparticles that will be able to seek out cancer cells and destroy them before they become a problem.<br> The robot industry will be dominant in the future. In fact, they will be everywhere, performing different dangerous and tedious tasks. By the end of the century, robots will also be nearly as smart as humans and may replace many jobs.<br> But with advanced technology also comes advanced dangers, especially biological warfare and global warming. In fact, the effects of global warming can be seen even now. Melting of glaciers and consequently drowning of cities. Development in robotics may also lead to eradication of the area's jobs and upending the nation's economy.
